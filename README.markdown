# SiK - Firmware for SiLabs Si1000 ISM radios

### Serveurperso branch specification

This is a modified 3DR Radio firmware intended for real time data streaming with high frame rate and low latency.
Original Time Division Duplex (TDD) and Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) code are removed, resulting a huge performance improvement in this case.
It offers a easy access through serial port to all most interesting features of the Si4432 (EZRadioPRO transceiver).

 - Advantages over RFM22 are reliability, no CPU time consumed (on hardware UART) and no memory used (no library needed on Arduino).
 - Advantages over XBee are better latency performance, better frequency choice, no transmit duty cycle limitation and open source.
 - The 3DRRadio configurator tool can be used but some parameters are changed or removed.

### Changes in features

"Baud", "Air Speed", "Net ID", "Tx Power", "ECC", "Min Freq", "Max Freq", "# of Channels", "RTS CTS" work as the master branch.
"Duty Cycle" and "LBT Rssi" are not currently used.

By default on HM-TRP, the RTS and CTS pins are used to drive external RF switches from the bidirectionnal amplifier

### "Mavlink" replaced with "RSSI Reporting"

With remote and local RSSI reporting enabled, you will get four supplementary bytes for each frames received on your ground station.
Byte order is remoteRssi, remoteNoise, localRssi and localNoise.

 - Select "RawData" to disable this feature and make a transparent serial link.
 - Select "Mavlink" to add two RSSI reporting bytes at end of each transmitted frames (useful on each remote modem).
 - Select "LowLatency" to add two RSSI reporting bytes over the serial port for each received frames (useful on the local modem).

### "Op Resend" replaced with "Set Channel"

If this feature is disabled then the transmit and receive frequencies are the same, equal to "Min Freq" (transparent serial link).
If enabled, you can transmit and receive on different channels, communicate with multiple isolated networks, make frequency hopping, all controlled by your main program.
You can define up to 250 channel frequencies using "Min Freq", "Max Freq" and "# of Channels".
Just add two supplementary bytes at the end of each frame you want to transmit, they're not transmitted to the other radios.
The first byte is used to set the channel immediately before the transmit, the second one is used after transmit to set the receive channel.
To sum up, a three bytes frame transmit the byte0 on channel byte1 and switch to the receive state on channel byte2.

 - An one byte frame is transmitted as is on the current channel.
 - A two byte frame can by used to get the noise level of multiple channels (start and length bytes), this is an useful feature to make scanners or spectrum analysers

### "Max Window (ms)" replaced with "Bootloader Main Frequency Override"

Override the frequency band defined by the bootloader.
Warning, the use of a different frequency band than that provided by the matching stage of your board results in a dramatic performance loss!

 - Valid values are 67 (0x43) for the 433MHz band, 71 (0x47) for the 470MHz band, 134 (0x86) for the 868MHz band, and 145 (0x91) for the 915MHz band.

SiK is a collection of firmware and tools for radios based on the cheap, versatile SiLabs Si1000 SoC.

Currently, it supports the following boards:

 - HopeRF HM-TRP
 - HopeRF RF50-DEMO

Adding support for additional boards should not be difficult.

Currently the firmware components include:

 - A bootloader with support for firmware upgrades over the serial interface.
 - Radio firmware with support for parsing AT commands, storing parameters and FHSS/TDM functionality

See the user documentation above for a list of current firmware features

## What You Will Need

 - A Mac OS X or Linux system for building.  Mac users will need the Developer Tools (Xcode) installed.
 - At least two Si1000-based radio devices (just one radio by itself is not very useful).
 - A [SiLabs USB debug adapter](http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBDebug.aspx).
 - [SDCC](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/), version 3.1.0 or later.
 - [EC2Tools](http://github.com/tridge/ec2)
 - [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) to build and run the GUI firmware updater.
 - Python to run the command-line firmware updater.

Note that at this time, building on Windows systems is not supported.  If someone wants to contribute and maintain the necessary pieces that would be wonderful.

## Building Things

Type `make install` in the Firmware directory.  If all is well, this will produce a folder called `dst` containing bootloader and firmware images.

If you want to fine-tune the build process, `make help` will give you more details.

Building the SiK firmware generates bootloaders and firmware for each of the supported boards. Many boards are available tuned to specific frequencies, but have no way for software on the Si1000 to detect which frequency the board is configured for. In this case, the build will produce different versions of the bootloader for each board. It's important to select the correct bootloader version for your board if this is the case.

## Flashing and Uploading

The SiLabs debug adapter can be used to flash both the bootloader and the firmware. Alternatively, once the bootloader has been flashed the updater application can be used to update the firmware (it's faster than flashing, too).

The `Firmware/tools/ec2upload` script can be used to flash either a bootloader or firmware to an attached board with the SiLabs USB debug adapter.  Further details on the connections required to flash a specific board should be found in the `Firmware/include/board_*.h` header for the board in question.

To use the updater application, open the `SiKUploader/SikUploader.sln` Mono solution file, build and run the application. Select the serial port connected to your radio and the appropriate firmware `.hex` file for the firmware you wish to uploader.  You will need to get the board into the bootloader; how you do this varies from board to board, but it will normally involve either holding down a button or pulling a pin high or low when the board is reset or powered on. 

For the supported boards:

 - HM-TRP: hold the CONFIG pin low when applying power to the board.
 - RF50-DEMO: hold the ENTER button down and press RST.

The uploader application contains a bidirectional serial console that can be used for interacting with the radio firmware.

As an alternative to the Mono uploader, there is a Python-based command-line upload tool in `Firmware/tools/uploader.py`.

## Supporting New Boards

Take a look at `Firmware/include/board_*.h` for the details of what board support entails.  It will help to have a schematic for your board, and in the worst case, you may need to experiment a little to determine a suitable value for EZRADIOPRO_OSC_CAP_VALUE.  To set the frequency codes for your board, edit the corresponding `Firmware/include/rules_*.mk` file.

## Resources

SiLabs have an extensive collection of documentation, application notes and sample code available online.  Start at the [Si1000 product page](http://www.silabs.com/products/wireless/wirelessmcu/Pages/Si1000.aspx)

## Reporting Problems

Please use the GitHub issues link at the top of the [project page](http://github.com/tridge/SiK) to report any problems with, or to make suggestions about SiK.  I encourage you to fork the project and make whatever use you may of it.

## What does SiK mean?

It should really be Sik, since 'K' is the SI abbreviation for Kelvin, and what I meant was 'k', i.e. 1000.  Someday I might change it.
